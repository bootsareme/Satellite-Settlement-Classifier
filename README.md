# Satellite Settlement Classifier
This repository contains the notebooks and supporting files for a collection of machine learning models designed to classify settlement types from satellite imagery. The project evaluates a range of approaches, including supervised shallow models, supervised deep learning architectures, and unsupervised methods. Local cached datasets are excluded due to GitHub's upload limit, but they can be regenerated by running the provided notebooks. For an in-depth discussion of the methodology and model comparisons, please consult the research paper associated with this project (link provided TBD).
